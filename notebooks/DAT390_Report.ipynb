    "Cancer is a deadly disease, which is responsible for over nine million death in 2018 \\cite{wth}. Therefore, it is crucial to find effective and efficient treatments. \n",
    "One of the most effective cancer treatments is radiotherapy, where cancer cells are killed using doses of radiation. \n",
    "However, the irradiation process not only kills cancer tumors but also affects healthy tissues surrounding the cancer tumor. \n",
    "Thus, accuracy in radiotherapy has to be increased to minimize the radiation dose delivered to healthy cells and maximize the dose to cancer tumors. \n",
    "If all of the radiotherapy steps are linked in a chain, tumor delineation is the weakest link, and its accuracy significantly impacts radiotherapy accuracy \\cite{Gudi2017}\\cite{Njeh}. Therefore, increasing the accuracy of tumor delineation is one of the challenges of radiotherapy treatment. \n",
    "Furthermore, a study conducted by \\citet{Weiss2003} shows that due to interobserver variability, when different radiologists delineate the same case, the variation of gravity centers of these tumors is up to 0.6-0.7cm. \n",
    "When analyzing the result of interobserver, the uncertainty in delineation is even larger than patient positioning and organ motion \\cite{Rusten2017}\\cite{Weiss2003}. Therefore, one method of improving the radiotherapy accuracy is having more than one radiologist in one case. However, the long waiting time to delineate tumor (4 hours for a trained radiologist) \\cite{Harari2010} makes this method almost impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, with the increasing of technology, tumor delineation can now be done automatically using deep learning, to be specific, using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The automatic delineation results can be used as one \"observer\" in radiotherapy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to delineate tumor like a radiologist, a deep learning model has to be created. This process contains repeating a group of actions such as model training (learning from radiologists), model testing, and model modification until the best model, which performs most similar to the radiologist, is found. The author calls this group of actions an experiment. Currently, there are many software libraries that help to create a deep learning model. However, these libraries are not specialized for CNN in medical images. Besides, creating and running experiments have to be done manually, which consumes time and effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project in DAT390 course is to create a Software Requirement Specification and a Software Design to develop a framework which automatically delineates cancer tumor as well as resolve the disadvantage of the existing deep learning libraries. The developed framework should satisfy the minimum requirements, in which users can use the resulted framework to perform a single experiment to delineate cancer tumors automatically."

    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the term of giving the machines human \"brain\" so that it can \"think\" as well as \"act\" like a human. Machine learning (ML), a subfield of AI, focuses on making predictions based on existing data. Deep learning is one of an approach in machine learning where the data is learned through layers of a neural network. In the context of automatic tumour delineation, AI means making a computer program to perform radiologists' jobs. In contrast, ML means analyzing each pixel in medical images and deciding if it belongs to a cancer tumor. Deep learning refers to one of the approaches of predicting cancer tumors by transforming the image data through a number of layers in a neural network.\n",

If we apply this figure to the current context, *Input X* refers to the set of medical images to be delineated. *True targets Y* refers to the delineation by a real radiologist. *Predictions Y'* refers to the delineation made by the neural network. The images data (*Input X*) go through each *layer* and transform by applying some *weights* in that layer. The outputs of each layer may be used as the inputs of another layer. This creates a network of layers. In many cases, an activation function is applied to the output of the layer. The output of the final layers is the *Predictions Y'*. By using the *Loss score* calculated by applying a *Loss function* on *Predictions Y'* and *True targets Y*, the *Optimizer* updates the *weights*. The goal of this learning process is to find the weights that minimize the *Loss score* so that the neural network can make predictions closest to the radiologist."

    "`h5` or `hdf5` is a file format that has the ability to store large dataset with compression and hierarchy, as well as meta-data. The main components of an HDF5 file are groups and datasets, where datasets are pieces of data that is stored in file while groups are containers of datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *deoxys* framework should have a HDF5 Data Reader, which is a Data Reader that process data from a hdf5 file. As a result, it should provide the three datasets: train, validation and test. Also, since an HDF5 file can be split into groups, the HDF5 Data Reader should provide an aid for configuring which groups of data to be in the three basic sets. It should be easy to configure different groups into different purposes for cross-validation. The suggested structure of hdf5 file to be used in the HDF5 Data Reader is to split the data into folds, where the users can configure which folds to be in the training set, or the validation set, or the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of the structure of a hdf5 file to be used in the HDF5 Data Reader, `\\fold_[n]` is the name of the group, and `col_[n]` are names of the datasets, each of which is the column data.\n",

    "- The column to be used as *True Target Y*\n",

    "- Which folds belong to which set. For example, users can configure `fold_0` and `fold_1` to be used for training, while `fold_2` is for validation and `fold_3` and `fold_4` are for testing. In another experiment, users can configure `fold_1` and `fold_2` to be used for training, while `fold_0`  is for validation. In this way, users can use cross-validation in the framework."

Moreover, it can find the best model of each metric based on the log files.\n",

    "By the time of creating this report, the development of the *deoxys* framework has satisfied the minimum requirements for running a single experiment. Users who are interested in automatic tumor delineation using deep-learning can try to create a model and run the experiment. The current development of *deoxys* can continue with many extensions and upgrades to create a more user-friendly framework with more features."
